Submitting pull requests:
-------------------------

Pull Requests are great!

1) Fork the Repo on github.
2) Create a feature/bug fix branch based on the dev branch
3) If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, please add a test!
4) Add your name to AUTHORS.rst
5) Push to your fork and submit a pull request to **the master branch**.

Please use **PEP8** to style your code (PEP8 compliance is tested Travis CI).

*You can check pep8 compliance before pushing by running the test suite with
the ``--pep8 -m pep8`` option*::

    ($ pip install pytest-pep8)
    $ python runtests.py --pep8 -m pep8
