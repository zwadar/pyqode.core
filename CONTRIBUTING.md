## Submitting pull requests:


Know how to fix something? We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

1. [Check for open issues](https://github.com/pyQode/pyQode/issues), or
   open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
   Opening a separate issue to discuss the change is less important for smaller
   changes, as the discussion can be done in the pull request.
2. Fork the relevant repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyQode), and start making your changes (you should base your work on the ``dev`` branch)
3. Check out the README and the CONTRIBUTING for information specific to that repository.
4. Push the change. we recommend using a separate branch for your feature.
5. Open a pull request.
6. We try to merge changes as soon as possible, or at least leave
   some feedback, but if you haven't heard back from us after a couple of days,
   feel free to leave a comment on the pull request.
