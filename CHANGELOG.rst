- Add a new mode that remember the cursor history (you can go back and go
  forward the cursor history by using Ctrl+Alt+Z and Ctrl+AltY)
- Add a new mode that can highlight a specific line of code (could be used
  in a debugger plugin to indicate the line where the debugger has been
  stopped...)
- SplittableTabWidget: add "Detach tab" option in the context menu.
- SplittableTabWidget: add a signal for when the editor has been created
  but the file has not been loaded yet
- SplittableTabWidget: add a signal for when the editor has been created

  COBOL->Compute field offsets, ...)
- CodeCompletionMode: add support for MatchContains if using PyQt5
- pyqode.core.share.Definition: add path attribute

- Improve Cache.get_encoding: it will try all preferred encoding if the file
  is not in the cache before giving up.
- SplittableTabWidget: Normalize case of input file paths when looking if The
  file is already open. Since Windows is not case sensitive, the file might be
  already opened but with a different case...
